## Inbox 

This is a great place to things that come up ad-hoc. Go through this list occasionally
 (during daily planning, for instance) and _move everything out_. Either schedule it, assign it to a project or area,
 or delete it. This ensures the inbox remains a functional temporary staging area.

## Day

This is where you spend most of your time. All your work for the day is here, including your schedule.
Staying on this screen helps you focus on what matters now.

## Week

This screen gives you an overview of what you have coming up this week. Space allows you to schedule tasks
on a week. This means you want to get these things done somewhere in the week, but you don't know when yet.
During daily planning, you review open tasks for the week and schedule what you can for today.

## Projects

If you need more structure, you can add tasks to projects. Projects should have a clear outcome in mind.

## Areas

For even more structure, you can also create areas. These represent unending aspects of your life. 
Projects can be part of an area (to do this, drag the project onto the area).
