Space supports adding tasks through Siri or Spotlight (on MacOS). 

## Adding tasks with Spotlight (MacOS)

Spotlight offers a quick way to add tasks to Space from anywhere on your Mac with a few keystrokes.
It is fast, and doesn't bring Space to the foreground, which is great for just quickly getting something 
out of your head and into your inbox.

First press your Spotlight keyboard shortcut (configure this in your Mac's System Settings). 
Then begin typing ```add to space```. As soon as you see it coming up, you can press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

You can then begin typing your task name, again hit enter, and select where you'd like to add the task. 
Or hit again immediately to accept the default of adding to your inbox.

## Adding tasks with Siri (iOS)

You can say "Add task to Space". Siri will respond asking you to name your task, 
and then where you want to store it. 
Valid options are inbox, today, tomorrow, this week, or next week.
