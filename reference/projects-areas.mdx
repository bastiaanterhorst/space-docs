## The difference between projects and areas

An **area** represents an ongoing part of your life, or a role you play. Like "work", "family" or "marketing".
A **project** on the other hand, is finite. It has a clear outcome in mind and you're working towards a 
day where you can mark the project complete and close it.

## Creating new projects and areas

You can create a new project or area from the File menu, or from + button at the bottom of the sidebar. 
When you hover over that +, a menu will pop up.

## Organising tasks in projects and areas

At first glance, a project or area might look exactly like the inbox -- but that is not the case.
One superpower that projects and areas have is groups. Groups allow you to create structure.
A group has a name, and you can drag tasks into it.

## Project progress and completion

As you check tasks off, you'll notice the process pie fills up. This provides a visual indicator
of the progress of your project.

You can click the progress pie to complete (or un-complete) the project. If there are still open tasks, 
you'll be asked if you are sure.

## Area emoji

Areas can have an emoji, to give them some color. You can set an emoji using the &hellip; menu or (on Mac) by
clicking the icon. Double clicking the icon removes the emoji.
