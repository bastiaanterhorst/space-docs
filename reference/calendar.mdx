## Calendar on Day and Week screens


On the day and week screens, Space offers a basic calendar that syncs with Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook Calendar.

You can create and edit events, as well as accept or decline invitations, without leaving Space.
You can also join video calls, either by opening the event and clicking the "Join Video Call" button,
or by hovering over the event and pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>.

## Tasks on your calendar

You can drag tasks onto your calendar. This creates an event which is linked to your task.
The event syncs to your calendar so others with access to your calendar can also see it.
The event is marked 'private', so they only see "Busy", rather than the full name and notes for your task.
