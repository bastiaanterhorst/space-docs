## Editing tasks

To begin editing a task, simply double click it (or tap it on iOS). You can then type away.
The buttons bottom-right allow you to take quick action on the task: move it, schedule it, 
or many other actions via the &ellipsis; menu.

<Info>
  You can accomplish many actions on tasks using just your keyboard. Check out [keyboard shortcuts](/reference/other-topics/keyboard-shortcuts)
</Info>

## Focus view

To make a task full screen, select it and pick Focus from the Task menu, context menu, or press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd>.
This view is great for writing, and blocking out distractions.
If your task is scheduled on the calendar, you will see the time. If it is scheduled for _now_, you will see how much
time you have remaining.
