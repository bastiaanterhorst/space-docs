Thanks for offering to take a look at what I’m building. I really want to know what you love and hate about the app, and how you would change it to meet your needs. If you have any feedback, please send it my way: [bastiaan@findspace.app](mailto:bastiaan@findspace.app)

There are Mac and iPhone versions of the app, and they sync. While you can start with either, I recommend starting with the Mac version since it has an onboarding and sample data. 

I also recommend starting with watching the intro video below, so you get a sense of the app. The in-app onboarding is extremely basic right now!

✌️ Take care,
Bastiaan
