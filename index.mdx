Space is a task manager and planner for Mac and iOS. You can download it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/space-life-planner/id6502294348). 
Next to most of the basic things you'd expect from a task manager, Space offers guided planning. This helps you zoom out and set long term goals, 
and then zoom in to make progress on those goals in your day to day.
