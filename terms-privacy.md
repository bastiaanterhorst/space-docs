** In a nutshell **

We take your privacy very seriously. Your tasks are stored by Apple, tied to your Apple account. We do not have access to this data. When you connect your calendars we only fetch the data used by the app to provide its services to you, and that data never leaves your Apple account either.

‍Privacy is very important to us at Map × Territory. One of our main aims is to collect the minimum amount of information from our users, in order to provide our services.
