## In progress

I'm currently rebuilding the calendaring backend to hook into Mac/iOS native calendar support. 
This will enable Space to work with *any* calendar provider that works on your Mac/iPhone and not just Google and Microsoft.

Also, as always, squashing bugs as I find them. Bugfixes will generally be released as hotfixes straight away.

## Updates

### 1.3 - Search

<Badge color="gray">Dec 3, 2025</Badge> Quickly find your tasks, no matter where they are hiding! One of the most requested features, Search lets you instantly find your tasks from anywhere. Sorting and filtering included.

Also, a whole bunch of small tweaks and improvements around performance, Mac icons, Siri/Shortcuts, and more.

### 1.2 - Repeating tasks

<Badge color="gray">Nov 7, 2025</Badge> Much requested and finally here: repeating tasks. Tasks can repeat upon completion or on a fixed schedule. You can also have repeating tasks automatically create events on your calendar, either at a fixed time, or by letting Space find time an opening in your schedule.

Finding an opening in your schedule respects your working hours, configurable in Settings. This feature also lets you create events for any task at the click of a button (or by pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>). Space will respect your working hours and existing commitments and try to find an opening for your task.

### 1.1 - Outlook support

<Badge color="gray">Oct 27, 2025</Badge> This release adds support for Outlook calendars. Add your Microsoft account and use your Outlook calendars in Space. Alongside your Google calendars, if you like.

Also: tuned icons, better keyboard handling, more robust weekly planning, copy improvements, and more.

### 1.0 - Here we go!

<Badge color="gray">Sept 27, 2025</Badge> After about two years of work and one year of beta testing, Space is out!
A big thanks to everyone who helped me in the process.
