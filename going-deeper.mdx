Most productivity apps focus on daily planning, but years of coaching and management experience have taught me that for many people, this is not enough to help them stay in flow and focus on the right priorities at the right time. While days matter, the leap from 24-hour blocks to an endless list of tasks creates paralysis and poor prioritization. Two things can help.

1. Zooming out by adding a **weekly planning layer** between daily actions and long-term goals. Taking out some time to decide what you want to achieve in your week will make your days a lot more effective.
2. Zooming in by **scheduling tasks on your calendar**. Especially for people who are in meetings a lot and live by their calendar, scheduling tasks can really help ensure the 'urgent' does not always overrule the 'important.

Finally, because I believe it provides for the best user experience, Space is a native app, works great offline, and has keyboard shortcuts for just about everything.

## Design Principles

Space was designed to be flexible, first and foremost. Because not everyone’s routine is (or should be) the same. Through over 10 years of managing people, 3 years of coaching and a lifelong interest in how to do meaningful work, it has become clear to me that while the same things won’t work for everyone, there are basic elements that everyone appreciates. Space focuses on providing you with those basic elements, while giving you the freedom to use them in a way that suits you. Some people like being highly structured, while others thrive with only minimal structure. Some people journal. Some people prefer planning ad hoc. Space tries to accommodate all of these and more, without getting in the way.

### Putting things in buckets

At the core of Space is the idea that considering the best *time* to do something is beneficial. It will help you make better decisions around what to do, and when to do it. In Space, you can plan ahead at three levels of resolution: the day, the week, and the quarter (coming soon — quarterly planning is not implemented yet!). 

You can pick and choose which of these resolutions you use, but the idea is that if you take the time to identify what is important to you this quarter, it will be easier for you to make high quality decisions on what should be done in a given week. And if you’ve decided what matters to you this week, it will be easier to decide what to do *today*.

In addition to these three buckets of time (the day, week, and quarter), Space supports two kinds of non-temporal buckets: Areas and Projects. Areas allow you to group tasks around never ending aspects of your life (examples include ‘work’, ‘marketing’, ‘social’, ‘exercise’). Projects on the other hand have a clear goal and outcome in mind (for instance ‘prepare Acme RFP’ or ‘paint the shed’). Projects can be grouped under Areas as well.

For lovers of structure, these two kinds of temporal and non-temporal buckets can be combined. You can schedule work that is part of an Area or Project on a Day or Week. This gives you a very clear overview of when what will happen and how your project will progress, approaching the insights you get from project management tools.

### If its not on my Calendar, I won’t do it

If your day is filled with meetings, or when your attention is regularly pulled in different directions, it can be hard to prioritize important work over the urgent things that come your way. One technique that is very effective is to put the work that needs to happen on your calendar, *dedicating* a chunk of time to it. As Stephen Covey put it: “Don’t prioritize your schedule, schedule your priorities”. I could not agree more. Space supports scheduling Tasks on your calendar to seamlessly bring together meetings with focused work. And because those Tasks really live on your calendar, others won’t be able to schedule meetings with you during your focus blocks, and you’ll be able to see your scheduled tasks from within your regular Calendar tool, as well as in Space.

### Habits are hard: Space Planning

I’ve mentioned doing daily check-ins, weekly planning, and quarterly planning sessions. I’ve noticed in my coaching that while many people agree that these are useful, and love the results when we do them together, it is really hard to turn them into habits. This is where Space helps you by reminding you to do them at the right times, and by guiding you through them.
