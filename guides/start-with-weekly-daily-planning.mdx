Planning your week and day is fundamental to Space. You will be reminded when its time to plan 
(and you can configure when), and guides through the planning process. The weekly planning process
aims to review your quarterly plan and see how you can make progress on it, this week.
The daily planning is about picking tasks off your list for the week.
