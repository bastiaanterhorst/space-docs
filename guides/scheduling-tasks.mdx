Space syncs with Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook. Besides showing your events, the most useful feature is that you can schedule
tasks onto your calendar. Not only does this give you a schedule for the day including your meetings 
and your important tasks, but it also prevents people from planning meetings when were intending to focus on some work.
The video below shows you how to set it up.
