## Why I built Space

As a longtime coach, a recuring theme with the people I work with is how much they struggle to make progress on
the things that truly matter to them, yet don't seem to align with their days. I noticed that what most people
lack is a habit of reflecting on their life, using those learnings to set goals for their future, 
and consistently using those long term goals to inform their long term actions.
And that's not surprising, since this is a lot to take if you have a busy life.

So I built Space. Space is designed to help you reflect. To remind you to plan, and guide you to set long term goals.
And then to recall those goals when planning your days, weaving your long term aspirations into your everyday 
tasks.
