## In a nutshell

We take your privacy very seriously. Your tasks are stored by Apple, tied to your Apple account. We do not have access to this data. 
When you connect your calendars we only fetch the data used by the app to provide its services to you, and that data never leaves your Apple account either. 
We integrate with RevenueCat for in app purchases, but ensure that RevenueCat only has access to an anonymous user ID. We use no tracking or analytics whatsoever.
